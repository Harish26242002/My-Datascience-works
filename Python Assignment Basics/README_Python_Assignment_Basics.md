## ▶️ How to Run

### Running `.py` Files
```bash
python filename.py
```

### Running `.ipynb` Files (Jupyter Notebooks)
1. Install Jupyter if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 💡 Example Usage

```python
# Example from 03_string_assignment.py
name = "Alice"
greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
print(greeting)
# Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Python** 3.8 or higher  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for `.ipynb` files)  
- Optional: **NumPy**, if required for `NP_assignment.ipynb`

Install dependencies (if any) using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
